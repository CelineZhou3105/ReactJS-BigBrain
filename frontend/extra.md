## Extra Features

When the user tries to navigate to a logged in page, the page will redirect the user out automatically back to the sign up page after 3 seconds.
This is to prevent user from accessing information that are restricted and only allowed access to information with account permission.
This is to improve security of the website.

Example: when the user is logged out and types /dashboard in the url, the dashboard page will have an alert that tells the user that they are not allowed here, need to sign up first, then redirect them after 3 seconds.
